## Introduction

This guide provides instructions on how to create a new Ballerina Extended Library module repository. 
It explains the directory structure and CI/CD configuration files that are required for a Ballerina Extended Library module repository.

Examples of the directory structure and common files can be found in existing Ballerina Extended Library module
repositories. The links to these repositories are available on the [Ballerina Extended Library Dashboard](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-extended-library#status-dashboard).

The [Ballerina Azure Service Bus Module](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-azure-service-bus) would be a reference to follow along with this guide.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/downloads)
- Install [Gradle](https://gradle.org/releases/) (7.1 or above is recommended)
- Create a [GitHub access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- Set up the following environment variables in your local environment.
    - `packageUser` - Your GitHub username
    - `packagePAT` - Your GitHub access token

## Repository Creation

- The new repository should be created under the [Ballerina Platform Organization](https://github.com/ballerina-platform).
- The repository request can be created by filling out the **GitHub Repo Creation Request Form** in WSO2 internal apps.

### Repository naming conventions

The repository name should start with the `module-ballerinax-` prefix and then the module name.

> Note: If the module is related to a known vendor (e.g. Google, AWS, etc.), it is recommended use the vendor name as a prefix, separated by a full stop.

Example Names:

- module-ballerinax-github
- module-ballerinax-aws.s3
- module-ballerinax-googleapis.gmail

## Repository Initialization

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the repository directory.
2. Run the following command to configure Gradle in your project.
   ```shell
   gradle init
   ```

   This will open an interactive Gradle CLI to initialize the repository. Use the *default options* to generate the Gradle scripts.

   Example output of the `gradle init` command:

   ```
   Select type of project to generate:
     1: basic
     2: application
     3: library
     4: Gradle plugin
   Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] # Select Option 1 (Hit Enter)
   
   Select build script DSL:
     1: Groovy
     2: Kotlin
   Enter selection (default: Groovy) [1..2] # Select Option 1 (Hit Enter)
   
   Project name (default: module-ballerina-sample): # Select the repository name (Hit Enter)
   
   Generate build using new APIs and behavior (some features may change in the next minor release)? (default: no) [yes, no] # Select no (Hit Enter)
   ```

3. Create a new directory named `ballerina` inside the repository. This directory will contain the Ballerina module source code.

```shell
mkdir ballerina
```

Move to the `ballerina` directory and initialize it as a Ballerina module.

```shell
cd ballerina
bal init 
```

Then follow the instructions in the following [Directory Structure](#directory-structure) section to add/update the files.

## Repository structure

Ballerina extended library modules should be structured to be aligned with the following directory structure.

```shell
.
├── .github/
├── ballerina/
├── ballerina-tests/
├── build-config/
├── compiler-plugin/
├── compiler-plugin-tests/
├── docs/
├── examples/
└── native/
```

### The `.github` directory [Required]

This directory contains the GitHub workflow scripts and other configurations required for the module. The following structure should be maintained in this directory.

```shell

##### The `central-publish-dev-stage.yml` workflow script [Required]

This workflow script is used to publish the module to the [Ballerina Central](https://central.ballerina.io/) DEV or STAGE environments. This workflow can be triggered manually on demand.

##### The `pull-request.yml` workflow script [Required]

This workflow script is used to build and run tests on pull requests. It has two main jobs, `Build on Ubuntu`and `Build on Windows`, which are required checks for a pull request.
This workflow script is triggered automatically when a pull request is created or updated.

> **Note:** The above-mentioned checks (`Build on Ubuntu` and `Build on Windows`) should be marked as `required` in repo settings.

### The `ballerina` directory [Gradle Submodule][Required]

This directory contains the Ballerina module source code including the `Ballerina.toml`, `Module.md`, and `Package.md` files and the tests.

## Ballerina Extended Library Dashboard

Once your Ballerina extended library is implemented and published to the Ballerina Central, you can add it to
the [Ballerina Extended Library Dashboard](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-extended-library#status-dashboard).
This dashboard is used to track the build status of all the Ballerina extended libraries.
Edit the [README.md](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-extended-library/blob/main/README.md) file of the
Ballerina Extended Library Dashboard and, add your library status badges to the table
under [Connectors](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-extended-library/blob/main/README.md#connectors-1)
section.
